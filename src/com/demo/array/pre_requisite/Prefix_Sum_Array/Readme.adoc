Given an array arr[] of size n, the task is to find the prefix sum of the array.
A prefix sum array is another array prefixSum[] of the same size, such that
prefixSum[i] is arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2] . . . arr[i].

Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 10, 5, 15]
Output: 10 30 40 45 60
Explanation: For each index i, add all the elements from 0 to i:
prefixSum[0] = 10,
prefixSum[1] = 10 + 20 = 30,
prefixSum[2] = 10 + 20 + 10 = 40 and so on.


Input: arr[] = [30, 10, 10, 5, 50]
Output: 30 40 50 55 105
Explanation: For each index i, add all the elements from 0 to i:
prefixSum[0] = 30,
prefixSum[1] = 30 + 10 = 40,
prefixSum[2] = 30 + 10+ 10 = 50 and so on.

To solve the problem follow the given steps:

Declare a new array prefixSum[] of the same size as the input array
Run a for loop to traverse the input array
For each index add the value of the current element and the previous value of the prefix sum array
